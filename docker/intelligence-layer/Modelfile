# Modelfile
# Defining the base personality for my Private Intelligence Node.
# I'm basing this on Llama3 because it has the best reasoning-to-weight ratio for my RTX 4090.

FROM llama3

# SETTING THE TEMPERATURE
# 0.7 is standard, but I want this node to be slightly more deterministic 
# and analytical for coding tasks, so I'm lowering it.
PARAMETER temperature 0.3

# CONTEXT WINDOW
# Expanding context to allow for larger document ingestion (Brainweave).
# Default is 2048; bumping to 8192 to handle full file reads.
PARAMETER num_ctx 8192

# THE SYSTEM PROMPT
# This is the "Ghost in the Shell". 
# It ensures the AI knows it's running on private infrastructure, not a public web chat.
